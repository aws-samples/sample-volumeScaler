# Summary

The management of storage resources in Kubernetes clusters is a critical aspect of cloud-native application deployment. PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) provide a way for applications to request storage resources, but their static nature can lead to inefficient resource utilization and operational challenges. The field of "cloud storage management," which aims to optimize storage resources in containerized environments, is becoming increasingly important as organizations adopt cloud-native architectures. While Kubernetes provides robust mechanisms for scaling compute resources, storage resources have traditionally required manual intervention for scaling operations.

`VolumeScaler` is a Kubernetes controller that extends the native capabilities of PVC management by introducing automated scaling functionality. The implementation leverages the Kubernetes Operator pattern and integrates with the Kubernetes API to provide a seamless experience for cluster administrators and application developers. The API for `VolumeScaler` was designed to provide a declarative and user-friendly interface to fast implementations of common operations such as PVC usage monitoring, storage capacity evaluation, and dynamic resource adjustment. `VolumeScaler` also relies heavily on and interfaces well with the implementations of storage classes and provisioners in the Kubernetes ecosystem [@KubernetesResourceManagement] (`storage.k8s.io` and `csi.storage.k8s.io`).

`VolumeScaler` was designed to be used by both cloud platform administrators and application developers managing storage resources in Kubernetes environments. It has been implemented using Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and integrates with Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers [@csi_spec_2022] (`storage.k8s.io` and `csi.storage.k8s.io`). The combination of automation, flexibility, and support for Kubernetes storage functionality in `VolumeScaler` will enable efficient management of storage resources in dynamic cloud environments. The source code for `VolumeScaler` is available on GitHub.


# Statement of need

The research in cloud-native storage management has gained significant attention as organizations increasingly adopt containerized architectures. While Kubernetes provides comprehensive solutions for scaling compute resources through features like Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) [@HPA], the platform lacks native mechanisms for automatically scaling storage resources. This gap in functionality presents an important research challenge in the field of cloud resource management.

Recent studies in cloud storage optimization [@k8s_storage_2023] have highlighted several key challenges in storage resource management:

1. Operational overhead: Administrators must manually monitor storage usage and perform scaling operations
2. Resource inefficiency: Static storage allocation often leads to either over-provisioning (increasing costs) or under-provisioning (risking performance degradation)
3. Response latency: Manual scaling operations cannot respond quickly to sudden changes in storage requirements

`VolumeScaler` addresses these research challenges by providing an automated, policy-driven approach to PVC scaling. The controller implements novel algorithms for:
- Real-time storage usage pattern analysis
- Dynamic threshold-based scaling decisions
- Integration with multiple storage backends through CSI [@csi_spec_2022]

This research contribution advances the field of cloud storage management by providing a practical solution to the storage scaling problem while maintaining compatibility with existing Kubernetes infrastructure. The implementation follows Kubernetes best practices [@k8s_controllers_2021] and serves as a reference architecture for future research in automated storage management.
